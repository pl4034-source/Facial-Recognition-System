# Facial-Recognition-System
Facial recognition is a biometric technology used to identify or verify individuals based on their facial features. It captures an image of a face and analyzes key characteristics such as the distance between the eyes, shape of the jawline, and contours of the cheekbones. These features are converted into a digital template known as a faceprint.
